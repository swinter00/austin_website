                <p>Austin Muthyala is a young and upcoming jazz trumpet player from Byron
                    Center, Michigan. He is a versatile musician that can blend into a variety of musical
                    styles. At 21 years old, as a member of MSU Jazz Orchestra he had the opportunity to
                    perform with many of todayâ€™s celebrated musicians such as: Terell Stafford, Melissa
                    Aldana, Harvey Mason, Tim Warfield, and Kenny Washington. He is a Geri Allen fellow
                    and a member of the Gathering Orchestra under the direction of Rodney Whitaker. <br><br>
                    In addition, professionally, he is a core member of Orquesta RITMO, one of the premier
                    salsa bands in West Michigan, as well as Global Village, SLOAN and the Filthy
                    Animals, and the BlueWater Kings organization. He is a student of Etienne Charles in his
                    senior year at Michigan State University. Currently, he is a member of the local music
                    scene in Lansing, MI.<br><br>
                    Most recently, Austin has begun the path of content creation by creating his
                    YouTube channel, muthybaby. Inspired by his favorite content creators (YouTubers and
                    streamers alike), he decided to take the plunge and use the new platform as another
                    means of sharing his music.</p>
